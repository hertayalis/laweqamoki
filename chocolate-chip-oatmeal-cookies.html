This is what helps to create that chewy hearty texture. By turning the thick rolled oats into a fine powder, it creates the perfect oatmeal chocolate chip cookie.</li><li><strong>Beat that Butter.</strong> Cream the butter for 3 minutes to get it light and fluffy. Add the sugars and beat for 2 minutes longer to make it smooth and creamy.</li><li><strong>Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl</strong> often to ensure even mixing.</li><li>Stir in dry ingredients and make sure not to overmix.&nbsp; Since we want tender cookies, it is important to not overwork the flour (which can create gluten and make tough cookies).&nbsp; Mix just until combined.</li><li><strong>Use both chocolate chunks/shavings and chips</strong>, if possible. By chopping up a block of chocolate or a chocolate bar, it creates ribbons of chocolate throughout the cookie.&nbsp; The chips give it structure and are meant to hold their shape while chocolate bars melt more easily.</li><li><strong>Chill the dough</strong>. Cookie Dough gets better with age. Remember chilling cookie dough for 24-48 hours makes the cookies that much better. It takes patience but it is well worth the wait.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Chip-Oatmeal-Cookie-Recipe-4.jpg alt="Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies Recipe.

I also like the 2-pack baking sheets from Costco and the price is right! I always look for light colored baking sheets as the dark baking sheets will draw more heat and the bottoms of cookies may burn more easily.</p><p>I also love to use easy cleanup <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00K282KY4 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong><span>parchment paper</span></strong> sheets</a>.

Less clean-up = happier Mommy.</p><h3>The Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookie Recipe Story:</h3><p>Now every good cookie starts with a story. These cookies are no different. It was 2011, which was almost five years before starting Modern Honey. If you have read about my health story in <strong><span><a href=# rel=noopener>my smoothies post</a></span></strong>, you know that I went on a super strict diet to help with some health issues. I even went gluten-free and dairy-free for a good amount of time. That’s not an easy feat for a baker like myself!&nbsp; I found out the Cooking Channel was on the hunt for the perfect cookie recipe in America. This was a dream contest for me and right up my alley!</p><p>I ended up <strong>winning the contest</strong> for the perfect cookie recipe! They flew me and Dean to New York City to film a segment for a show in the Food Network Studios (<a href=# rel=noopener><span><strong>you can read about it here</strong></span></a>). I was ecstatic for the trip and to experience NYC! I couldn’t wait to EAT my way around the city. The only problem was that I was still on a pretty strict diet — no gluten, no dairy. Bye, bye bakeries.&nbsp; I was shooting a show the next afternoon so I had to withstand the temptation for only one more day. I could do it, right? It was all fine and dandy until I watched Dean scarf down two pieces of New York cheese pizza. It was then when I experienced coveting at it’s finest.</p><p>Then, it really happened. We stumbled upon this little bakery which I had heard about for a long time called Milk and Cookies. They specialize in cookies, which is basically the way to my heart. I had to go in and see it, smell the cookies, and dream about eating them. I was walking into the den of temptation and was I strong enough to withstand the smell of butter, chocolate, and sugar wrapped into one? Hmm…not sure this was the smartest idea.</p><p>I convinced Dean it was totally cool for him to get a cookie or two. He opted for two Milk and Cookies famous chocolate chip cookies sandwiched together with vanilla ice cream in the middle. I wasn’t jealous AT ALL. I literally stood there and took pictures of him eating it. I was vicariously living through him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dean-Stadler-at-Milk-Cookies-New-York-City.jpg alt="Milk and Cookies Bakery in New York City.

After filming was all done and on the last day of our trip, I would return and get my very own cookie. This is what kept me going.&nbsp; I tried<strong> this NYC legendary cookie and it was chewy, it was crispy, it was chocolate-y, and I loved it!</strong> It was well worth the wait. So, when I saw that Milk and Cookies came out with their very own cookbook, you better believe I thumbed through to find the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe. This recipe is an adaption of Milk and Cookies Bakery Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies. I hope I did them justice.
