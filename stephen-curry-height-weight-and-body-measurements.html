brother, Seth Curry, also plays for the NBA.&nbsp;So, it wasn’t a career path chosen on a whim, but make no mistake, he earned his right to be in the NBA.</span></p><p><span>Stephen is often considered the best shooter in NBA history and before being voted MVP in 2014-15, he became the first player in NBA history to be unanimously voted MVP at the 2015-16 season.&nbsp;He’s got a pretty impressive portfolio, but you know that’s not what we’re here to check out.</span></p><p><span>Without further ado, let’s get into the subject of his stats starting with Stephen Curry.</span></p><p><span>See also: Ben Affleck’s tattoos, children and brothers</span></p><h2><span>Stephen Curry</span></h2><p><span>Some basketball players are born tall, but then can you guess which category he belongs to based on Stephen Curry’s height of 6ft 3in?</span></p><p><span>We won’t let you rack your brains, here’s the answer in the form of a trip down memory lane.&nbsp;Young Stephen Curry was not tall, nor was he built.&nbsp;So we had a 5-foot-6, underweight teenager who really wanted to shoot for a living.</span></p><p><span>But the big guns won’t notice With an average of 20 points per game in high school, one summer his father decided to help him stand out by training him to change his shot, and years later he made himself a name.&nbsp;Even today, he can still be described as “small,” the NBA is a tough crowd to please, but Curry turned his skepticism into awe.</span></p><p><strong><span>Don’t Miss: Lebron James height, Beyonce height, Selena Gomez feet, Shaquille O’Neal, Kim Kardashian age, Kendall Jenner height, How tall is Danny Devitos, How tall is Danny Devitos, Hendrix Hart Hendrix Hart, Will Ferrell wife</span></strong></p><p><span>Although at first glance he might be considered unathletic, the player hasn’t let that become a limitation, Stephen Curry’s height is actually an added bonus.</span></p><p><span>Here’s what his dad had to say to ESPN about his accomplished son, ‘He’s the all time man.&nbsp;He looks like an ordinary guy when the public has a hard time getting along with these very tall, muscular men.&nbsp;And despite that, he comes out and beats them at their game. Add to that the fact that he’s a simple, approachable man, and you’ve got it all.&nbsp;»</span></p><p><span>Personalities who share the same award as Stephen Curry are Muhammad Ali, Prince William Duke of Cambridge and Chris Hemsworth.&nbsp;If you ask me, he’s in very good company.</span></p><p><span>See also: Cameron Diaz Husband, Sister and Feet</span></p><h2><span>Stephen Curry</span></h2><p><span>Let’s cut to the chase, Stephen Curry weighs 190 pounds or 86 kg, but don’t let his slender body fool you, he’s probably a lot stronger than people think he is.&nbsp;Do you want proof?&nbsp;Apparently, Stephen can lift 400 pounds.</span></p><p><span>Because of that, here’s what Keke Lyles, a leading expert on injury prevention and optimizing physical potential, had to say about Curry: “Steph is the second most powerful player on our team, but his height is ridiculous. .”</span></p><p><span>He continues to prove that body stats aren’t anything when it comes to following your dreams, it’s all about maximizing potential.&nbsp;The thing is, Curry doesn’t prefer to weigh more than 400 pounds, so his intention is to avoid weight gain.&nbsp;Most of his work focuses on stability and the mastery of one’s forces.</span></p><p><span>It seems to be working well for him and the Warriors assistant general manager Kirk Lacob said this: “If Steph moves 98% of people in the world will get hurt trying to run like that, I think people would pay to watch it to work.”</span></p><p><span>Besides his work outings, you can bet Stephen eats well, he and his wife, Ayesha Curry, believe in maintaining a healthy, biography diet.&nbsp;Having a healthy food blogger as a wife certainly helps.&nbsp;They eat high protein foods, lots of vegetables and healthy starches.</span></p><p><span>This is how this NBA star maintains a good weight and good health.</span></p><h2><span>body measurements of stephen curry</span></h2><p><span>Along with Stephen Curry’s height and weight, we have some of his stats here for you.&nbsp;There is nothing on the athlete’s chest, biceps and waistline, believe us, we checked literally under the rocks.</span></p><p><span>On the plus side, we have his shoe size here for you.&nbsp;Curry wears a US size 13.5, European size 46.5 and UK size 13.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirpJq9qbHNZpquqqKueqmxyKCfrWWnmraotNNmmKecXZe8pcWMppyaq6Wnsq6xza2qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-deion-sanders-jr-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Deion Sanders Jr. Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./romulo-braga-biography-actor-age-series.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Romulo Braga Biography - Actor Age, Criminal Code Series</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
