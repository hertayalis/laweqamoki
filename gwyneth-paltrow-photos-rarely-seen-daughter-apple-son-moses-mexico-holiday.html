What a beautiful family, and I love [Mexico], my old home." Another remarked: "Apple is a Bridget Bardot twin!"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Do not miss</h4><p id=eZe3CMeW_V data-wc=60>Some were quick to point out that Apple - who is currently studying at Vanderbilt University - looks very much like her father, Coldplay musician Chris Martin. "And her father's twin," said one, while another added: "She looks like her father with her grandmothers eyes. Beautiful." Another post read: "Apple is the perfect mix of Margot Tenenbaum & Chris Martin."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/359bf515b826-apple-martin.jpg><p id=evkufiHyxf data-wc=40>Gwyneth shares both her children with ex-husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Chris Martin</a>, whom she was married to from 2003 to 2016, and in 2018, the actress tied the knot with <a class=hm-link href=#>Brad Falchuk</a>, who is a dad to his own children, Isabella and Brody.&nbsp;</p><p id=eG3-bwuHAC data-wc=62>Last month, the 51-year-old star opened up to People about Apple and how much she is loving student life. "I mean, she's just so much fun to be with," explained Gwyneth. "It's so wonderful having a daughter because you have this amazing best friend and we like to do the same stuff, and she's so funny and she's so smart. It's amazing."&nbsp;</p><p id=erZH7K26xH data-wc=28>The actress added: "My children are similar in the ways that they're both incredibly sensitive and empathetic.

That's how it will be forever. "Some days it's not as good as it looks. We also have good days and bad days, but I think it's driving towards the same purpose of unity and love and what's best for [our kids]."&nbsp;</p><p id=eDbmtxiCKw data-wc=29>The mum-of-two explained: "No matter what you think, how you think you were wronged or how bad you perceive the other person's actions, or whatever the case may be.&nbsp;</p><p id=emCz-QvWKX data-wc=48>"If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it's presenting in the world and in your relationship, then there really is somewhere to go and something to learn and something to heal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dn2PaWluZ5esxq%2Bx06FkqZmcqb%2Bww4ypn6isn6h6s63RnqOyZaOasq95w5qsoKCkmr9urc%2Bpo55lo6S7brnOrJysZZ2axaqvzmafqKSZma66ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./helen-mort.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Helen Mort</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dorothy-bush-koch-net-worth-140579.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dorothy Bush Koch Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
