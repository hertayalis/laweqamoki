But despite his growing status as a sex symbol, Hartnett was against showing off his skin on camera.</p><h2 id=h-josh-hartnett-took-a-break-from-hollywood-because-of-his-stardom>Josh Hartnett took a break from Hollywood because of his stardom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-2_59>In his younger years, Hartnett was considered an A-list superstar with several noticeable films under his belt. It helped that his looks and charisma gave him a reputation of being a heartthrob. But eventually, Hartnett chose to <a href=#>take a break from the spotlight</a>. The attention that came with his newfound celebrity profile became too much for his personal life.</p><p id=par-3_83>“I was on the cover of every magazine. I couldn’t really go anywhere. I didn’t feel comfortable in my own skin. I was alone. I didn’t trust anyone. So I went back to Minnesota and got back together with my old friends — ended up getting back together with my high school girlfriend for a while — and I didn’t do any filming for 18 months,” Hartnett once said in an interview with Details(via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a>). “I’m still finding my way through all that.”</p><p id=par-4_27>After returning to the film industry, Hartnett found himself fighting for roles in a way he didn’t have to before. But he considered this a good thing.</p><p id=par-5_79>“I didn’t have to struggle as an actor, although I think that I’ve made up for it now,” Hartnett added. “I still get offered films and TV roles, luckily, but years ago, if I saw a role I wanted, there was a good chance I could grab it. When I see a role now, I’ve got to fight for it. It’s not bad. It’s actually more rewarding. Depressing when something doesn’t go your way, but only for a minute.”</p><h2 id=h-josh-hartnett-would-challenge-taking-off-his-shirt-in-films>Josh Hartnett would challenge taking off his shirt in films</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_33>Hartnett was willing to go shirtless on screen if the film called for it. But whenever the opportunity presented itself, <a href=#>the Penny Dreadful actor</a> confided that he’d fight to keep his clothes on.</p><p id=par-7_46>“I’m not comfortable with it yet, but we’ll see. Some people have this meat-market mentality, so you’ve got to take your shirt off because it will bring girls into the theater. When that comes up on set, I challenge it,” he once said speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview</a>.</p><p id=par-8_17>One of the reasons Hartnett didn’t feel comfortable going shirtless was because of issues regarding his body.</p><p id=par-9_29>“I don’t have a very good body. Some of these guys work out every day. I work out maybe once a year, so they’ve got me beat,” he added.</p><h2 id=h-josh-hartnett-only-feels-alright-with-nudity-if-it-serves-a-purpose>Josh Hartnett only feels alright with nudity if it serves a purpose</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_23>Although <a href=#>the Pearl Harbor star</a> has expressed his concerns for nudity, disrobing is easier for him if it has a purpose behind it.</p><p id=par-11_38>“On film, if it doesn’t help the story, it’s not my favorite thing. I do show some stuff in the show, but I fight to make sure that it’s funny or character driven,” Hartnett once confided to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sL%2FHZp%2BaqqSjsrXAjJyfmqScmruoscNmq5qjmaO0br%2FHoqmtZZaeua6%2FjJ2gnaakYq%2BwsNhnn62lnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./masterchef-season-10-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MasterChef Season 10: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./javagal-srinath.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Javagal Srinath</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
