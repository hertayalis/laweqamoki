As part of this evening’s action, <span class=caps>MLB</span> fans will be treated to the Shohei-Show, when the Los Angeles Angels host the slumping Pittsburgh Pirates.</p><p>Not counting the All-Star Game, we have cashed five tickets in this article, narrowly missed 16 winners, and had 14 tickets seemingly dead on arrival. Playing longshot parlays each day, these results are within the parameters of what is expected.</p><p>In this article, we never post a ticket with shorter than +700 odds, meaning that we only need to hit once each week to be profitable, which we have achieved to date. Overall, these plays are 55-46-1 (55.0%) if played as straight wagers, many of which have been significant alt-lines, even as individual tickets.</p><p>Below, we break down our favorite longshot (+900) look for July 21, focusing on today’s matchup between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Angels!</p><p><strong>Today’s Odds + Potential Payout Based on Investment</strong><br>DraftKings Sportsbook Users = $5 to payout $50.00<br>DraftKings Sportsbook Users = $10 to payout $100.00<br>DraftKings Sportsbook Users = $25 to payout $250.00<br>DraftKings Sportsbook Users = $50 to payout $500.00</p><p>Don’t live in a state with sports betting this baseball season?

Coming out of the All-Star break, the Pirates lost five consecutive games before beating the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday. Before the break, Pittsburgh lost eight of their last 10 games. Nevertheless, the Angels have not been much better – losing nine of 10 games heading into the break before having a little bit of success across the last week of action. At significant plus money, the Pirates are worth including in this longshot parlay, as they have extreme value against another mediocre baseball club in this matchup.</p><h3>2+ Total Bases (+115)</h3><p>has shown promise at times in 2023, but he has still been mostly inferior against left-handed batters. Entering play on Friday, Oviedo owns a 4.73 <span class=caps>FIP</span> and has allowed 23 extra-base hits across the platoon. continues to pace Major League Baseball in the vast majority of power metrics, giving him plenty of value at plus money in this spot.</p><h3>7+ Strikeouts (-290)</h3><p>According to props.cash, has recorded at least seven strikeouts in eight of his 10 starts at home this year. In his two misses, he had six strikeouts both times – meaning that he is consistently competitive at this market number in front of the home fans. Tonight, he gets an incredibly favorable matchup against a Pittsburgh offense that ranks 21st in strikeout percentage against right-handed pitching during the month of July. Trust him to get the job done here.</p><p>Don’t have access to parlay betting at online sportsbook?
