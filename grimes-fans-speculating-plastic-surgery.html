And now, a week later, Grimes has shared another post-op photo without the bandages, but it’s still not apparent.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>“R selfies obsolete yet?” she tweeted, sharing another photo of herself with oversized lips and her silver-lavender hair braided into pigtails. “I am very seriously considering getting a white ink tattoo on my face next week. Any thoughts? It feels like it’s time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>R selfies obsolete yet?</p><p>I am very seriously considering getting a white ink tattoo on my face next week</p><p>Any thoughts?

It’s the opinion of this author that she probably got her ears pinned back, a procedure known as otoplasty — which perhaps might be a first step into her quest for elf ears.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>But of course, that’s all just speculation, as her fans likewise went into serious detective mode trying to figure out what’s different.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>“What was the surgery that you’ve mentioned here we wanna knowww,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> one Twitter user, while another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a>: “You can see where the injections were to her lips but I def thought there were gonna be elf ears under the head wrap too and you def don’t need to be in a hospital gown for fillers lol so I’m wondering the same.”</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Others expressed concern about Grimes’s rapidly transforming appearance. “Post-billionaire body dysmorphia phase in full swing!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> another user. “Don’t slice off too much of yourself, you are fine just as you are.” Others <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">floated</a> that she was “serving allergic reaction” and needs an epi-pen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">or that</a> she no longer looks like herself.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=false>In either case, try as fans might, it seems unlikely that Grimes will be dissuaded from getting a face tattoo or elf ears, so everyone may as well get used to the idea now — for better or worse. (But almost certainly worse.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0s7XMnqpmnpGjwG6%2Fz56arqSRqbavs4ypo5qrpJ6wbr%2FUq56eqqlk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-storm-net-worth-200010.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Storm Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-ashbys-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Andy Ashby Dating Andy Ashby's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
