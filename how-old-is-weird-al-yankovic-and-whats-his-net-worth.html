Al spent most of his childhood in nearby Lynwood, California. He would get his first public exposure on the Dr. Demento radio show in 1976 when Demento played a tape Al had given him, and this kickstarted his career.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>This means that Weird Al is 63 years old at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-what-is-weird-al-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Weird Al’s net worth?&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Weird Al has a net worth of $20 million.

According to the RIAA, three of these albums have gone gold, five have gone platinum, and one has gone double platinum, showing that Al has sold millions of records.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>But Al hasn’t just stuck to music. He has also moved into many other mediums. For instance, Al has acted in his own TV show and even starred in the movie UHF, a movie Al also co-wrote. He’s also an accomplished voice actor, having roles in&nbsp;The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy,&nbsp;&nbsp;Transformers: Animated,&nbsp;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, BoJack Horseman, and&nbsp;Milo Murphy’s Law.&nbsp;This is on top of a load of appearances in popular online media.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Al is also a successful writer, winning awards for his 2011 children’s book&nbsp;When I Grow Up&nbsp;and its sequel, My New Teacher and Me!
