Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie</h4><p id=ehdnPPvIlyO>Known by the legendary portmanteau 'Brangelina', the uber A-listers wed in a French chateau in 2014 some nine years after first becoming entwined on the set of 2005 blockbuster Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Things went south soon after with allegations of abuse surfacing in 2016, the same year Angelina filed for divorce. After seven years of legal wrangling light appeared at the tunnel's end, with the&nbsp;MailOnline reporting in July 2023 that the pair had agreed to a mediation which could resolve their dispute.</p><h4><strong>2. Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson</strong></h4><p id=eeFFD521Lyx>Ryan and Scarlett married in 2008 in a secretive ceremony on Vancouver Island. Both actors' stars were firmly in the ascendancy but professional success wasn't conducive to conjugal happiness, and their union was annulled just over two years later with Scarlett subsequently revealing the couple hardly saw each other.&nbsp;</p><h4>3. Russell Brand and Katy Perry</h4><p id=e7wn394znW>The polysyllabic and polyamorous British actor/comedian/presenter met popstar Katy in 2009 during rehearsals for the MTV Video Music Awards. The following year the pair married in a traditional Hindu ceremony in India and all seemed set fair. But with Katy away on her California Dreams tour for most 2011, the couple supposedly determined they had different priorities and Russell filed for divorce - via text message - at the end of that year.</p><h4><strong>4. Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore</strong></h4><p id=eDEPdFV-bf>The couple divorced in 2013 after it emerged Ashton had been unfaithful on the weekend of their sixth anniversary. In 2015 Ashton remarried, this time to his That '70s Show costar Mila Kunis who was five years his junior - a notable change in dynamic from his relationship with Demi who was 15 years his senior.</p><h4>5. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes</h4><p id=eq0IotUnUd>The archetypal whirlwind romance, Tom and Katie got engaged after just seven weeks of dating in 2005. The pair didn't muck about and the following year they both welcomed daughter Suri and got married in a Scientologist ceremony in Italy. The marriage lasted for five and half years before Katie filed for divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/590be7f7a5de-theinterview-z.jpg><h2>Jonathan Bennett - Aaron Samuels&nbsp;</h2><p id=ebV9Ba7_8aCj9 data-wc=51><strong>Jonathan still has starring roles - but now he's all about TV presenting!&nbsp;</strong>After roles in Cheaper By the Dozen 2&nbsp;and Van Wilder: Freshman Year,&nbsp;he has gone onto host popular foodie shows including Cake Wars&nbsp;and Halloween Wars.&nbsp;He got engaged to his partner, Jaymes Vaughan, back in 2020.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d62ea459007-aaron-1-z.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tpYGd9c32PbnBtbF%2BisqK6jKCgq6SjYsSpsdGeZJqqlWKwor%2FTZqWor18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tabitha-swatosh-net-worth-323041.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tabitha Swatosh Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./703286-lil-tecca-teases-bnyx-produced-track.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Tecca Teases New BNYX-Produced Track</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
