The seventy-five-year-old has earned the moniker ‘Catwoman’ and’The Lion Queen.’</p><p>In her mid-seventies, Jocelyn leads a lavish lifestyle, complete with a plethora of spotlights. Alec N. Wildenstein, a fellow millionaire, was her husband. From 1978 through 1999, the couple was married for twenty-two years.</p><p>Wildenstein has amassed a net worth of <strong>$10 million</strong> as of 2021, according to celebrity net worth. While the sum may appear large to the socialite, it is insignificant when compared to her previous worth as a billionaire. Alec, her ex-husband, has a net worth of <strong>$10 billion</strong> as of 2021.</p><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein, a former billionaire, knows how to live like one by living a lavish lifestyle and spending a large portion of her income on her comfort. When her yearly phone bill and wine prices were computed at roughly <strong>$547, 000</strong>, she gained a lot of notoriety. In addition, her divorce deal with Alec netted her a stunning <strong>$2.5 billion</strong>.</p><p>Wildenstein underwent a series of plastic surgery procedures on her face, resulting in a radically different appearance. She squandered a large portion of her fortune on many plastic procedures. The Catwoman even sold her previous New York home for a whopping $13 million to real estate entrepreneur Janna Bullock.</p><p>Her love connections, aside from her cosmetic changes, are also fascinating. Wildstein hasn’t been married, but she has had the experience of being a wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/YouTube-300x300.jpeg><h2>Relationship status of Jocelyn Wildenstein:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein has been involved in a number of well-known romances in the past. She dated Swiss Cyril Piguet, a producer of several top films, including ‘Un Commerce tranquille,’ before marrying Alec N Wildenstein. At the time, the diva was just seventeen years old.</p><p>For a long time, Jocelyn and Piguet’s love was doomed. Sergio Gobbi, an Italian-French filmmaker, was in another relationship with the plastic surgery star. Sergio spent a lot of time with her in Paris. It was in that fantasy metropolis that she honed her hunting and piloting skills. Wildenstein was married to Lloyd Klein, a French couturier, for over a decade after her divorce, from 2003 until 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Glamour-Fame-1-300x300.jpeg><h2>Divorcee To Alec N Wildenstein:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein, an American socialite, is a former millionaire, thanks in part to her ex-husband Alec N. Wildenstein. Alec comes from a long line of art dealers, which explains why he has a net worth of $10 billion.</p><p>Wildenstein married businessman Alec Wildenstein in 1978 after courting for several years. When the lovebirds exchanged vows, they were both in their forties. The couple had been married for twenty-two years. In the midst of it all, they brought two gorgeous children into their lives.</p><p>Despite spending over two decades together, Jocelyn Wildenstein and Alec N Wildenstein’s relationship ended badly. When the Cat Woman discovered her husband sleeping with a 19-year-old Russian model, the couple separated in 1999. The art dealer became so enraged that he threatened Jocelyn with a gun, putting the diva in a strong negotiating position in their divorce settlement.</p><h2>Jocelyn Wildenstein’s Early Life:</h2><p>Jocelyn Wildenstein was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, on September 7, 1945. At the age of 17, she began dating film producers and directors. She then relocated to Paris, where she honed her skills as a hunter and pilot.</p><p>When it comes to the Wildenstein family, there is no formal information available. She prefers to keep her personal life secret. Education details are also unavailable.</p><h2 class=simple-facts-title>Facts of Jocelyn Wildenstein</h2><table id=factsDetails class="highlight rubik-font sidefacts" style=width:50.6462%><tbody><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Full Name</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>Jocelyn Wildenstein</td></tr><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Nationality</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>Switzerland</td></tr><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Date of Birth</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>1945/9/7</td></tr><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Birth Country</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>Switzerland</td></tr><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Birth Place</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>Lausanne, Switzerland</td></tr><tr><th style=width:50.7148%;text-align:left><span style=font-weight:400>Sexual Orientation</span></th><td style=width:58.8231%>Female</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKKfmLKtxc1mrqKklJq7tMDEoqVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jose-eber-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jos Eber Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jools-oliver-rare-comment-daughtes-launches-fashion-collection-next-exclusive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive: Jools Oliver reveals touching bond she shares with daughters after confirming exciting ne</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
