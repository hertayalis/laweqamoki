"I think there are a lot of times when she's happy to take a role in the friendship where she's supporting her friends."</p><p>"I think that this summer, she voiced to me and to a couple of the housemates that she felt like she wasn't getting that support in return and that the friendship was starting to [not] feel equal," she continued, adding, "I know she felt a little bit neglected."</p><p>While Sam admits that none of the housemates really formed alliances when it came to Danielle and Lindsay's feud, the Summer House star confirmed that she was put in the middle as she's friends with both women.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I think every person forms their own opinion about the relationship and about the fight that Danielle and Lindsey have been in.

Because all we want to do is mediate, you know, you'll see, throughout the rest of the summer," Sam said.</p><p>The Summer House star told us that fans will see her and <a href=#>Gabby Prescod</a> try to "facilitate conversations" and give advice to the former friends throughout Season 7.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, are Lindsay and Danielle friends now?</h2><p>Well, it seems the two women have not sorted through their issues. After Lindsay and Carl announced their engagement, fans were quick to point out that Danielle did not congratulate the couple on social media. In October 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay admitted that she and Danielle </a>were at odds and not really speaking at the moment.</p><p>So, did the former besties make up?</p><p>According to Sam, she and the rest of the castmates are "really hoping for a resolution" between Lindsay and Danielle.</p><p>"We have the reunion in a couple of weeks and hopefully, that's where we'll sort some of this out as a group, as a family," she said. "Because that's what we are, we're a family and sisters fight.
