I don’t mean ever; I mean as children,” Portman told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;recently.</p><p>Portman doesn’t regret starting her own acting career in her pre-teen years because her parents were able to watch over her while she was on set.</p><p>“I feel it was almost an accident of luck that I was not harmed, also combined with very overprotective, wonderful parents,” the “Thor” actress explained.</p><p>“You don’t like it when you’re a kid, and you’re grateful for it when you’re an adult,” she added.” I’ve heard too many bad stories to think that any children should be part of it.”</p><p>“Ultimately, I don’t believe that kids should work,” Portman proclaimed. “I think kids should play and go to school.”</p><p>Portman is now mom to two children, Aleph, 12, and Amalia, 6, but her comments indicate her offspring will not be following in her child star footsteps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/american-actress-natalie-portman-set-72816197.jpg><p>Aside from starring in the 1994 action thriller, she also appeared as Padmé Amidala in “Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace” when she was still in high school.</p><p>Her other early roles include the 1996 drama “Beautiful Girls” and 2000’s “Where the Heart Is.”</p><p>The Marvel actress has previously spoken up about her teenage life in the spotlight.</p><p>Portman appeared on<a href=#> Dax Shepard’s&nbsp;“Armchair Expert”&nbsp;podcast</a>&nbsp;back in 2020 and noted that being 12 on the set of “Leon” “didn’t allow the full expression of who I was at that time.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Being sexualized as a child took away from my own sexuality because it made me afraid,” she went on.</p><p>Portman then recalled that many people “had this impression of me that I was super-serious and prude and conservative as I got older.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image-upgraded-17-6-x-72816074.jpg><p>“I consciously cultivated that because it was a way to make me feel safe. If someone respects you, they’re not going to objectify you.”</p><p>She sighed: “At that age you do have your own sexuality, and you do have your own desire and you do want to explore things … but you don’t feel safe necessarily. You build these fortresses.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Portman recalled how males over-sexualized her when she was a teenager. She recounted at the <a href=#>Women’s March</a> how when she opened her fan mail, there would be rape fantasies that men had written about her.</p><p>&nbsp;“A countdown was started on my local radio show to my 18th birthday, euphemistically the date that I would be legal to sleep with. Movie reviewers talked about my budding breasts in reviews,” Portman revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma21fmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvNmquapJmaerG70a2kmqZdqK66v4ycn6KklKeyr3nSoaaupJRiu7DAjJucZq%2Bfp7iqusZmoKdlmKS5rcXWqKadZZGbwaa%2BjKyfnmWnlsBuv8SxrJqkma%2BypXnIp2SfoaKowW65zq%2BgnmWRqXqis8RmaGtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ninkendo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ninkendo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-scarlett-schneider-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Scarlett Schneider Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
