He is a singer, songwriter and producer known under the stage name Big Smo. In addition, Big Smo adds to his net worth as a film director. Big Smo became famous after the release of his studio album “Kuntry Livin’” (2014) which managed to find a place on the Billboard Top 100 chart in the USA. Big Smo has been active in the entertainment industry since 1999.</p><p>How rich is this artist? The latest estimations show that Big Smo’s net worth is as much as $3 million. The main source of his net worth is music career.</p><h3>Big Smo Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Big Smo was born to parents Carl Avery Smith, a veteran of the US Navy, and Mary Jane Smith, who now also manages him. He was raised outside of Shelbyville, Tennessee, and while studying at high school he played the drums and trumpet. In 1999, Smo took his first steps in the music industry, composing tracks and performing in a bar. His first recordings under minor recording labels started to be released in 2002, and included “Kuntry Kitchen” (2002), “The Audio Biography” (2003), “Monument Society” (2004), “The True Soft” (2007) and “American Trade” (2010). None of them appeared on the music charts, but still started his net worth to grow. Big Smo’s major label studio album entitled “Kuntry Livin’” (2014), showed up in 2014. The album contains 14 tracks and a few of them featured such performers as Alexander King, Haden Carpenter, Frankie Ballard and <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>. The total length of the album is 47 minutes 4 seconds, and it received moderate reviews from critics though audiences loved it, and it reached 3rd place on the Rap Chart, 6th place on the Country Chart and 31st on the main music chart of the USA. These successes contributed significantly to Big Smo’s net worth.</p><p>In addition, three EPs were released, the first two of which managed to appear on the Billboard Top 100, too. “Grass Roots EP” (2012) reached the 71st position on the Country chart and “Backwoods Whiskey” (2013) 69th position on Country as well as 39th on Heartseekers chart in USA. Another charting song was “My Place” (2014) with <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>, which appeared in 49th position of Country chart in USA. No doubt that all those recordings added to Big Smo’s net worth, too.</p><p>His music style is considered as rural rap. Smo owns his personal website where his fans may read the latest news, check tour dates, listen to his music, look at photos or watch videos, and purchase various stuff in store or join the community.</p><p>Additionally, the television series entitled “Big Smo” aired on A&E channel, and was created around his music and life. Big Smo himself appeared in an episode of the reality television series “Bar Rescue” (2013) on Spike created by Darrin Reed. All these engagements on television have also added sums to Big Smo’s net worth.</p><p>Big Smo is married to Whitney Crocker, and the family resides on the farm in Unionville, Tennessee.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.5768194070081><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 14, 1976 (age 39</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Diego, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Whitney Crocker</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>John Smith , Andrew "Mitchell Dick" Keller , Boss of the Stix , Hick Ross</td></tr><tr readability=0.42105263157895><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/bigsmo</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/therealbigsmo</a></td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Big Smo</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpugoGWjorxuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./reggie-wells-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oprah Winfreys Former Makeup Artist, Reggie Wells Dead at 76, Information About The Death Is Bein</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zion-williamson-girlfriend-who-is-ahkeema.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zion Williamson Girlfriend: Who Is Ahkeema?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
