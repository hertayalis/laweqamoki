up-and-coming singers and musicians in the music industry.&nbsp;Learning the ropes from his father, a professional musician, it’s no surprise the young talent is heading to the top in a very short time.&nbsp;His father, who taught him at an early age to play several musical instruments, let him find his own way and Landon did not disappoint him.</span></p><p><span>His productive collaboration with Lil Skies in the track&nbsp;</span><span>Red Roses</span><span>&nbsp;brought him to the public’s attention and he became even more popular with songs like&nbsp;</span><span>19, Drive My Car</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>.&nbsp;His popularity is felt on both SoundCloud and YouTube where he has an admirable following number on both platforms.&nbsp;Armed with the dream of becoming a successful music producer, the rising star continues to follow in the footsteps of legendary musicians such as Frank Ocean, Michael Jackson and of course Prince.&nbsp;Although the accolades haven’t started yet, the level of progress he’s made so far is a clear indication that it won’t be long before Landon earns some really big honors.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography and age of Landon Cube</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born in Maryland on February 1, 1998, Landon Cube is the son of a professional musician who, during his musical debut, held hands to teach him to play several musical instruments.&nbsp;Landon has, in turn, featured his father in his Instagram posts, but consciously did not reveal his name till date.&nbsp;However, he named his father as his inspiration, as well as his tutor.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, he had his mother featured in several of his YouTube videos, including the video titled&nbsp;</span><span>Mom Reacts To Lil Skies – Red Roses</span><span>.&nbsp;Again, Landon Cube was very careful to keep his mommy identity under wraps.&nbsp;Information about his siblings has never been made public, which may mean he is likely his parents’ only child.</span></p><p><span>Social media is not overflowing with information about his degrees and the institutions he attended, given his level of achievement.&nbsp;he seems to be well educated.</span></p><p><span>Relationship-wise, hardly anything has been heard on his behalf, perhaps this is due to the fact that he wants to focus on his career at the moment.&nbsp;In addition, given his young age, he still has plenty to discover the world of romance.</span></p><p><span>Landon Cube is partnered with Cameron Haller – a famous YouTuber who is also his very good friend.&nbsp;Cameron runs the CUFBOYS YouTube channel where he uploads reaction vlogs as well as videos.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Musical career</span></strong></h2><p><span>His passion for music resurfaced in 4th grade, and eventually he picked up the guitar and started learning the basics under the watchful eye of his father – a professional musician who he says is his inspiration.&nbsp;In 2013, he shared his music videos on YouTube with his songs including&nbsp;</span><span>American Dream</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Euphoria</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Victim</span><span>.&nbsp;He hit SoundCloud three years later with several of his songs uploaded to the channel in 2016. Before the year was out, he covered&nbsp;</span><span>Cold Water</span><span>&nbsp;(Major Lazer and Justin Bieber),&nbsp;</span><span>Self-Control</span><span>&nbsp;(Frank Ocean) and&nbsp;</span><span>Beamer Boy</span><span>&nbsp;(Lil Peep).&nbsp;The same year, he sang and produced the single&nbsp;</span><span>18</span></p><p><span>Landon Cube then took off with his May 2017 single&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>.&nbsp;He wasted no time in releasing other singles like&nbsp;</span><span>19, Legend</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Mad of the New World</span><span>&nbsp;which followed the same year.&nbsp;Landon’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;appeared in January 2018 and the same year he contributed to Louis Luv’s song&nbsp;</span><span>Quel est le Luv</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Driving My Car</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Beachtown</span><span>&nbsp;leading in the most watched video stakes on its Youtube channel.&nbsp;Along with Lil Skies, he was featured in&nbsp;</span><span>No Jumper</span><span>&nbsp;– a September 2016 podcast by Adam22.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is Landon Cube net worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s still early days for the young talent, but he’s slowly making his mark in the competitive world of music.&nbsp;His salary is not yet known but his wealth has been estimated at $125,000 by some sources.&nbsp;With more musical efforts, the amount may soon become an insignificant figure for the artist.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Landon Cube stands at a height of 5 feet 8 inches and sports a slim build.&nbsp;Details on his other measurements are not available at this time.&nbsp;However, the American musician has light brown hair and light brown eyes as distinguishing physical characteristics.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikkaOxsLqMnKybnV2XtrB5wKCcZq%2BZoLZutMSinqGsXaOytXnMrqqim18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lwo-merchandise-selling-very-well-right-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>LWO Merchandise Selling Very Well Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kohlrabi-slaw.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kohlrabi Slaw</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
