If I'd had kids, I'd have stayed at home with them.

We weren't doing anything to stop it. In fact, we thought maybe we would. We even had names if we did, but it didn't turn out that way."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/145f03812e46-gettyimages-1439402768.jpg><p id=e8TQRISkh3 data-wc=28>The 77-year-old continued: "Now that Carl and I are older, we often say, 'Aren't you glad we didn't have kids?

The condition means tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in the body, causing extreme pain. People with endometriosis can struggle to fall pregnant, with stats revealing 30–50% of people with endometriosis find it hard to get pregnant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e94071ab8c3d-dolly-parton-white.jpg><p id=eO_1-aTBPe data-wc=45>Dolly went on to have a partial hysterectomy when she was 36 meaning she wouldn't be able to have children naturally. Her operation seriously impacted her, and writing in her book she shared: "Suddenly I was a middle-aged woman. I went through a dark time."</p><p id=eEmw4VaWzH data-wc=33>Although Dolly and Carl never welcomed any children, it's clear this hasn't <a class=hm-link href=#>had an impact on their marriage</a>, which has lasted for over 50 years, with the pair tying the knot in 1966.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: All you need to know about Dolly Parton's love story</figure><p id=e5Tj_Mmug1 data-wc=29>During an appearance on the Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2, Dolly admitted that Carl doesn't "volunteer" honest answers but he does share his opinion when asked.</p><p id=ev-3R5z0zS data-wc=68>"Not in a cruel way! But if I ask him if he likes my hair – 'too stringy for me' or 'it looks too important' - you know like if it's too stiff... he always calls it that, 'It looks too important', but I know if I ask him - he won't just volunteer it - but if I ask him he'll tell me the truth," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6f2143d10841-dolly-parton-husband-carl-dean.jpg><p id=exOEUL8QE0 data-wc=35>In fact, she credited their mutual openness as the secret to their happy relationship. "We've been together 59 [years], we dated two years, and then we just celebrated our 57th anniversary on May the 30th."</p><p id=eX5xOsOGeW data-wc=68>But I think so much of it is the fact that we are honest and open and we have a warped sense of humour!
