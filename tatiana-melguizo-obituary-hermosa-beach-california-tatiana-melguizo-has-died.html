She was a much-loved member of the community. She had reached the age of 24. A member of the Wilamo family, she was the cherished daughter of Marco and Angela Wilamo, in addition to being one of four siblings.</p><p>Edwin Alex Wilamo, Susanne Wilamo Corpus, and Edwin Ariel Wilamo were some of her siblings to whom she was related. Tatiana was also appreciated and loved by her niece and nephew, Angie Wilamo, Tyler Diaz, and Gavin Corpus. They were very close to her. There was a spot in each of their hearts reserved specifically for you. After completing her high school education at Alexander Hamilton High School, Tatiana continued her study at Westchester Community College, where she earned her diploma.</p><p>The entirety of her professional life was devoted to serving the community, and she worked at Northwell Hospital with an unwavering dedication to her job. Love was something that Tatiana felt for her family and friends, and it was something that was always there in her life. She was well-known for her infectious excitement, her love of Spanish music and Bad Bunny, and her love of musical genres.</p><p>In addition to her daily cup of coffee, which provided her with comfort and warmth, she was also well-known for her fascination with musical genres. Because of her dazzling personality and the fact that her smile was so radiant that it could illuminate a whole room, Tati was the focal point of any party she attended. In addition to getting red tattoos, viewing sunsets, and entirely immersing herself in the enchanted world of Harry Potter were the activities that she enjoyed doing the most.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwwMCtoJqmkWK6prjGrqCzp12kr6rA1JqpsmWYmr%2Buu9KaZJudkZi1bq%2FApaCfp6KjtqJ505qropmelnquscugrKKyn2K1or%2BMnaCenF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./50-cent-diddy-beef-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Beef Between 50 Cent and Diddy, Explained</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shorsey-season-3-release-window-cast-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shorsey season 3 release window, cast, and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./daphne-oz-net-worth-67264.html>Daphne Oz Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./energy-balls.html>Energy Balls</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./holly-rowe-net-worth-2024.html>Holly Rowe Net Worth 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-to-get-into-the-chamber-of-secrets-in-hogwarts-legacy.html>How to get into the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts Legacy</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./143165-loretta-lynn-sings-a-birthday-concert-he-html.html>Loretta Lynn Sings at a Birthday Concert in Her First Public Performance since Suffering a Stroke</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
