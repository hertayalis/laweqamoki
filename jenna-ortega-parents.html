Her parents, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie and Edward Ortega</a>, are of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent and worked "normal" jobs as they raised Jenna in Coachella Valley.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Jimmy Kimmel</a>, Jenna shared that her mom is a full-time emergency room nurse — and would drive Jenna out to auditions.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"So, four or five times a week, my mom was a full-time ER nurse, but she would drive me —&nbsp;it was a six or seven-hour round trip L.A. and back — for auditions ... and she has five other kids," Jenna shared.</p><p>However, now that Jenna is a popular actress, she does not get treated any differently by her parents or <a href=#>her siblings </a>—&nbsp;Aliyah, Mia, Markus, Mariah, and Isaac.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I have a very supportive family," she said during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a>. "They sacrificed a lot so that I could do what I do. Another thing I love about them is that they don’t care at all about what I do."</p><p>She continued, "They have no interest whatsoever in this world or in the film industry. I could come home from work with cool people, prominent people, people I looked up to, and they weren’t interested. They were like, ‘hey, you didn’t do the dishes before you left, so you’re going to have to do them all week.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenna was raised bilingual — and has been very vocal about her Latin upbringing.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Jenna's mother is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent while her father is Mexican American. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celeb Suburb</a>, Jenna is 75% Mexican and 25% Puerto Rican.</p><p>Her great-grandmother on her maternal side chose to relocate from Mexico to the United States with four of her daughters in tow. Jenna's grandfather on Natalie‘s side was originally born and raised in Puerto Rico before moving to New York City.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jenna opened up about being bilingual with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>.</p><p>"Since my father does not speak Spanish, trying to teach my siblings and me the language, when we were little, was a struggle," she said. "My mom is bilingual because her grandmother babysat her often and taught her Spanish. The plan was for her to speak it to us and for my father to speak English so that we could learn both languages."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She went on to explain that her family has done their best to keep the most important traditions alive over the years, including piñatas during birthday celebrations and freshly made tamales at Christmas time.</p><p>Jenna was also vocal about the fact that her ethnicity sometimes slowed her down in the entertainment industry.</p><p>"As a Latina, there are not as many roles out there for me," she explained. "When I first started out, it was hard. I was constantly shut down because I did not have the look they were going for. You have to keep pushing.”</p><p>Her parents definitely did a great job raising Jenna!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusBmpquslZyubrzAq5ynrKM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mansory-gives-the-mercedes-cls63-amg-a-carbon-fiber-makeover.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mansory gives the Mercedes CLS63 AMG a carbon fiber makeover</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-michael-rady-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Michael Rady Make?
